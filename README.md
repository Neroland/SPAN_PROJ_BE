# SPAN_PROJ_BE
Welcome to Dario's SPAN Back End Project.

This repo has the project details for the back end challenge. 

Within the ranking.py, you will find the comments that flow through the program.

If you are seeing this, there is a backend firebase database that stores all the previous tournament, the access.json file is needed to access the database. Only those that need access to the .json credential file has recieved it.

I hope you like it! :)
